                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <h3>A little bit of me:</h3>
                <p>My journey into the world of programming began at the age of 10, driven by curiosity about how websites and games were created. Through extensive research, I discovered that the magic behind it all lay in code, which led me to learn Python and create my first game based on a story I had in mind.</p> <br>
                <p> Over time, my passion for development grew, and during my studies in the Management and Programming of Information Systems (GPSI) program at a vocational school in Portugal, I had the chance to deepen my knowledge. It was there that I specialized in web and game development, mastering languages and tools like C# and broadening my technical expertise.</p>
